In this workout we further our understanding and practice of creating data 
structures and working with repositories. The data that we will be working 
with is that of 2018 NBA players. From this we clean and wrangle, and 
produce several output files. 

In our `data` subdirectory, we have the raw `nba2018` data. A dictionary 
is provided to clarify the variable meanings within the data set, as well as 
give some basic information about the data frame. From this data we create 
team data, by aggregating individual statistics based on their 2018 teams. 

In the `code` subdirectory contains the R script used to construct the 
team data set. From this we also created two other summary outputs: 
`efficiency-summary` and `teams-summary`, which contain select 
summary statistics. These can be found in the `output` subdirectory. 

The `report` subdirectory contains our final output, along with the 
graphics that we produce in our various ranking methods.
